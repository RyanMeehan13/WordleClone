# WordleClone
A python program I wrote to imitate the viral game Wordle. 
The rules are as usual for wordle, except that instead of pressing the enter key to confirm a word, you press the period ('.') key. 
The game isn't mean't to be too serious or optimized, it was just something I put together in a day or so to practice working with ``tkinter``.
